# AndroidTTS

I created this very basic application during my sophomore year of high school while I was still learning how to program. Earlier that year, my grandfather was diagnosed with Bulbar Palsy (a form of ALS that eventually results in the inability to speak). About three months after being dianogsed, my grandfather completely lost his voice. It was disheartenining to see so I decided to create this application to make his communication easier.

This was my first Android application, so please ignore any unconventional code. It is also slightly outdated, so ignore any use of deprecated libraries or features in those libraries.
