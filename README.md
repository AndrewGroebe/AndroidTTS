# AndroidTTS

I created this very basic application during my sophomore year of high school while I was still learning how to program. Earlier that year, my grandfather was diagnosed with Bulbar Palsy (a form of ALS that eventually results in the inability to speak). About three months after being dianogsed, my grandfather completely lost his voice. It was disheartenining to see so I decided to create this application to make his communication easier.

You may wonder why we didn't use one of the many other TTS alternatives, and that is simply because I wanted to make this application personalized. If you look through some of the features, you can see buttons personalized to him. Examples include "How was school, Charlie?" (my youngest cousin who he picked up from school everyday) and his restaurant orders.

This was my first Android application, so please ignore any unconventional code. It is also slightly outdated, so ignore any use of deprecated libraries or features in those libraries.
